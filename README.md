# giantswarm-e2e-tests

Ginkgo suites for e2e testing the Giantswarm Platform.

## Running the tests

Get the kubeconfig for the management cluster where the workload cluster will be created / is running

```
$ opsctl login $installation --self-contained mc-kubeconfig.yaml
```

### Creating a new workload cluster

Then run ginkgo

```
E2E_KUBECONFIG_PATH=$PWD/mc-kubeconfig.yaml ginkgo clusters
```

### Using an existing workload cluster

You can run the tests against an already existing workload cluster

```
E2E_WC_KUBECONFIG_PATH="$PWD/e2elyek9m.kubeconfig" E2E_WC_NAME="e2elyek9m" E2E_WC_ORG_NAME="e2elyek9m" E2E_KUBECONFIG_PATH=$PWD/mc-kubeconfig.yaml ginkgo clusters
```

## Logs

You can get logs on what's happening by running ginkgo in verbose mode
